    <h2><a href="petCalc/index.html">Pet and Attendant EXP Calculator</a></h2>
    A simple Javascript tool that calculates the amount of EXP pills needed to get your pet or attendant to a certain level.<br>
    Primarily useful for knowing how many of each pill to get to the different skill book breakpoints; not the only use however.
